# Anomaly Detection in 4D Flow MRI's

### Description

This project presents a deep learning-based approach for the detection of anomalies in 4D flow MRI data. By employing self-supervised learning and reconstruction-based techniques, our model efficiently identifies abnormal blood flow patterns. The repository contains the code, data processing scripts, and evaluation tools developed during the study.
